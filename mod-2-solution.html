        <div class="section-content">
            <p>Lord Brahma is considered the creator in Hindu cosmology and is one of the members of the Holy Trinity, alongside Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer. While Brahma is recognized as the creator, he is not as widely worshiped as Vishnu and Shiva in contemporary Hinduism. In iconography, Lord Brahma is depicted with four faces, each facing a cardinal direction, symbolizing his vast knowledge of the cosmos. He is often portrayed holding a rosary (mala) and the Vedas, representing the knowledge necessary for creation. Legend has it that Brahma is born from a lotus emerging from the navel of Lord Vishnu. Despite being the creator, Brahma's role diminishes over time, and there are relatively fewer temples dedicated exclusively to his worship.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Lord Vishnu</div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>Lord Vishnu is a prominent deity in Hinduism, revered as the preserver and protector of the universe. According to Hindu cosmology, he is one of the principal deities in the Holy Trinity, known as the Trimurti, alongside Brahma, the creator, and Shiva, the destroyer. Lord Vishnu is often depicted with a serene and benevolent demeanor, holding a discus (chakra), a conch shell (shankha), a mace (gada), and a lotus flower. His mount is the mythical eagle, Garuda. It is believed that Lord Vishnu incarnates in various forms (avatars) to restore cosmic order and protect dharma (righteousness). The most well-known avatars include Rama and Krishna. Devotees worship Lord Vishnu for guidance, protection, and the preservation of harmony in the universe.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Lord Shiva</div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>Lord Shiva, also known as Mahadeva or the Great God, is a central figure in Hinduism and is regarded as the supreme deity in the Shaiva tradition. As the lord of destruction and transformation, Shiva is part of the Holy Trinity, along with Brahma, the creator, and Vishnu, the preserver. Shiva is often depicted with a third eye, symbolizing insight and wisdom, a crescent moon on his head, the sacred river Ganga flowing from his locks, a snake around his neck, and a trident (trishula) in his hand. He is also associated with asceticism and meditation. Devotees revere Lord Shiva for his role in destroying the old to make way for the new, symbolizing the cyclical nature of existence. The dance of Shiva, known as the Tandava, represents the cosmic cycles of creation, preservation, and dissolution.</p>
